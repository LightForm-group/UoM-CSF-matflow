# Example tasks

The YAML files in this directory are not intended to be complete workflows, but are instead designed to give example parametrisations of different tasks/methods. Note that to ensure the files can still be run as if they were valid workflows, a `context` parameter is given to each task. The `context` parameter is not usually necessary when using the task within a complete workflow (except in some specific situations).
