    "The `name` parameter is used when MatFlow generates a directory for the workflow; this directory will be the name, followed by a date and time stamp. Here, `stats` is set to `false`, meaning MatFlow will not run extra accounting jobs to record extra information like the memory usage, which is usually not needed, but might be useful when performing benchmarking. The `archive` key is set in this case to `dropbox`, which is the name of an archive location definition within my `~/.matflow/config.yml` file. Within the config file, the archive location is defined like this:\n",

We also specify for how long loading should continue, and over how many increments DAMASK should partition the load case. Notice that the loading keys specified here are lists, rather than single numbers. This is to support multiple sequential load cases within the same simulation. For instance, we could load first at a strain rate of 1e-3, and then at a strain rate of 1e-4. Alternatively, we might want to increase the number of increments per unit of strain in the elastic-plastic transition region, to make sure we sample the curvature sufficiently well."
